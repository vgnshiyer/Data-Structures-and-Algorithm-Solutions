## Greedy Algorithms

A greedy algorithm constructs a solution to the problem by always making a
choice that looks the best at the moment. A greedy algorithm never takes back
its choices, but directly constructs the final solution. For this reason, greedy
algorithms are usually very efficient.

The difficulty in designing greedy algorithms is to find a greedy strategy that
always produces an optimal solution to the problem. The locally optimal choices
in a greedy algorithm should also be globally optimal. It is often difficult to argue
that a greedy algorithm works.

Generating a generalized greedy approach that could solve any programming problem is unknown.
