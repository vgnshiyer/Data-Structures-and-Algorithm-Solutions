# Object oriented programming

### Class
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects that define a set of attributes (data members) and behaviors (methods) that the objects will have.

A class defines the characteristics and behaviors of objects that belong to that class. It describes the data that an object can hold and the operations that can be performed on that data.

For example, a "car" class might have data members such as "make", "model", "year", and "color", and methods such as "start", "stop", "accelerate", and "brake". Objects created from this class would represent individual cars, each with its own set of values for the data members and the ability to perform the methods defined in the class.

Classes are a fundamental concept in OOP, and they allow programmers to create reusable code that can be used to create multiple objects with similar characteristics and behaviors.

### Objects
In object-oriented programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class that has its own unique set of data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) based on the blueprint defined in the class.

An object is created using the constructor method of its class, which sets the initial values of its attributes. Once an object is created, it can be manipulated by calling its methods, which can modify the object's attributes and perform other actions.

For example, consider the "car" class we mentioned in the previous answer. An object created from this class would represent a specific car, such as a 2018 Honda Civic with a red exterior. The object's data members would hold the values of the car's make, model, year, and color, while its methods could be used to start the engine, accelerate, or brake.

Objects are a key component of OOP, and they allow programmers to create modular and reusable code that can be easily extended and modified. Objects can interact with each other and with other parts of a program, making it possible to build complex systems with many interconnected parts.

Example,
```
public class Car {
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    private String color;
    
    public Car(String make, String model, int year, String color) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
        this.color = color;
    }
    
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting the engine.");
    }
    
    public void accelerate() {
        System.out.println("Accelerating.");
    }
    
    public void brake() {
        System.out.println("Applying the brakes.");
    }
}
```
In this example, the Car class is defined using the public class keywords, followed by the name of the class (Car). The class has four private data members (make, model, year, and color), which are accessed and initialized using a constructor method that takes arguments for each data member.

The class also defines three public methods (start, accelerate, and brake) that can be called on objects created from the class. These methods print messages to the console indicating the actions being taken.
```
Car myCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2018, "red");
myCar.start();
myCar.accelerate();
```
In this example, a new object myCar is created from the Car class by calling its constructor method and passing in the arguments for make, model, year, and color. Then, the start and accelerate methods are called on the myCar object, which prints messages to the console indicating that the engine is starting and the car is accelerating.

**What is a constructor?**
In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method that is used to initialize the data members of an object when it is created. The constructor has the same name as the class and is typically defined with the def keyword in Python or the public keyword in Java.

When an object is created from a class, the constructor is automatically called to initialize its data members to their default values or the values passed in as arguments.

```
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String email;
    
    public Person(String name, int age, String email) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.email = email;
    }
}
```
In this example, the constructor method Person takes three arguments (name, age, and email) and initializes the object's data members with these values using the this keyword.

Some properties of constructors:
1. Name: Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to. This ensures that the constructor is automatically called when an object of the class is created.

2. Access level: Constructors can have different access levels, such as public, private, or protected, which determine whether they can be called from outside the class or only within the class.

3. Parameters: Constructors can take parameters to initialize the object's data members with specific values. This allows for greater flexibility in creating objects with different initial states.

4. Default constructor: If no constructor is defined for a class, a default constructor is automatically created by the compiler. This default constructor initializes the object's data members to their default values.

5. Overloading: Like other methods in a class, constructors can be overloaded to take different combinations of arguments. This allows for multiple constructors to be defined with different initialization logic.

6. Initialization order: Constructors can call other constructors in the same class or in a parent class to perform initialization logic in a specific order. This can be useful when there are dependencies between the object's data members or when initializing inherited data members.

7. Return type: Constructors do not have a return type, as their primary purpose is to initialize the object's data members rather than return a value.

**What is method overloading?**
Method overloading is a feature in object-oriented programming where multiple methods can have the same name but different parameters. In other words, a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different argument lists.

When a method is called, the compiler determines which method to call based on the number and types of arguments passed in. If multiple methods have the same name but different argument lists, the compiler will choose the appropriate method based on the argument types.

```
public class MathOperations {
    public int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
    
    public double add(double x, double y) {
        return x + y;
    }
    
    public int add(int x, int y, int z) {
        return x + y + z;
    }
}
```
In this example, the MathOperations class has three methods called add, each with a different number or type of arguments. The first method takes two int parameters and returns their sum, the second method takes two double parameters and returns their sum, and the third method takes three int parameters and returns their sum.

When we call the add method with different arguments, the compiler will choose the appropriate method based on the types of the arguments. For example:
```
MathOperations math = new MathOperations();
int sum1 = math.add(2, 3);          // calls the first add method
double sum2 = math.add(2.5, 3.5);   // calls the second add method
int sum3 = math.add(2, 3, 4);       // calls the third add method
```

Method overloading allows programmers to define multiple methods with the same name but different argument lists, making code more readable and easier to use. By providing different versions of a method that take different types of arguments, we can make our code more flexible and versatile, allowing it to handle a wider range of inputs.

**What is the this keyword?**
The this keyword is a reference to the current object instance in object-oriented programming. It is used to refer to the current object's members (fields and methods) and to differentiate between local variables and instance variables with the same name.

In Java, the this keyword is commonly used in the following ways:

1. To refer to instance variables: When an instance variable has the same name as a local variable or parameter, the this keyword can be used to refer to the instance variable. For example:
```
public class Person {
    private String name;
    
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

2. To call another constructor in the same class: If a class has multiple constructors, the this keyword can be used to call another constructor from within a constructor. This is known as constructor chaining. For example:
```
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private int age;
    
    public Person(String name) {
        this(name, 0);
    }
    
    public Person(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

3. To return the current object: When a method needs to return the current object instance, the this keyword can be used as the return value. This is commonly used in method chaining, where multiple methods are called on the same object instance. For example:
```
public class StringBuilder {
    private String str;
    
    public StringBuilder append(String str) {
        this.str += str;
        return this;
    }
    
    public StringBuilder reverse() {
        this.str = new StringBuilder(this.str).reverse().toString();
        return this;
    }
}
```

### Inheritance
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class can be defined based on an existing class, inheriting all its properties and methods, and extending or modifying them as needed. The existing class is known as the parent or superclass, and the new class is known as the child or subclass.

Inheritance allows us to reuse code and build more complex and specialized classes by building on existing classes. It also enables polymorphism, where a subclass can be treated as its parent class, allowing for greater flexibility and modularity in our code.
```
public class Animal {
    protected String name;
    protected int age;
    
    public Animal(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
    
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("I am an animal.");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        super(name, age);
    }
    
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
    public Cat(String name, int age) {
        super(name, age);
    }
    
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Meow!");
    }
}
```
In this example, we have a parent class Animal that has two instance variables name and age, a constructor that sets these variables, and a speak method that prints a message to the console.

We also have two child classes Dog and Cat that extend the Animal class. These subclasses inherit the name and age variables and the speak method from the Animal class, but they also have their own speak methods that override the parent speak method to provide a different behavior for each subclass.

Here's an example of using these classes:
```
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal1 = new Animal("Animal", 1);
        animal1.speak(); // prints "I am an animal."
        
        Dog dog1 = new Dog("Fido", 3);
        dog1.speak(); // prints "Woof!"
        
        Cat cat1 = new Cat("Whiskers", 2);
        cat1.speak(); // prints "Meow!"
    }
}
```
In this example, we create an instance of each class and call their speak methods. The Animal object prints the message "I am an animal.", while the Dog object prints "Woof!" and the Cat object prints "Meow!". This demonstrates polymorphism in action, where each object can be treated as its parent class Animal, but the Dog and Cat objects have their own specialized behavior defined in their speak methods.

1. Single inheritance:
In single inheritance, a subclass extends a single parent class. This is the most common type of inheritance. For example:
```
class Animal {
    void move() {
        System.out.println("Animals can move");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dogs can bark");
    }
}
```
In this example, Dog is a subclass of Animal. It inherits the move() method from Animal, and adds a new bark() method.

2. Multilevel inheritance:
In multilevel inheritance, a subclass is derived from another subclass, which is derived from a parent class. For example:
```
class Animal {
    void move() {
        System.out.println("Animals can move");
    }
}

class Mammal extends Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Mammals can eat");
    }
}

class Dog extends Mammal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dogs can bark");
    }
}
```
In this example, Dog is a subclass of Mammal, which is a subclass of Animal. Dog inherits the move() method from Animal, the eat() method from Mammal, and adds a new bark() method.

3. Hierarchical inheritance:
In hierarchical inheritance, two or more subclasses extend the same parent class. For example:
```
class Animal {
    void move() {
        System.out.println("Animals can move");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dogs can bark");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void meow() {
        System.out.println("Cats can meow");
    }
}
```

In this example, both Dog and Cat are subclasses of Animal. They both inherit the move() method from Animal, but Dog adds a new bark() method, while Cat adds a new meow() method.

4. Multiple inheritance:
Multiple inheritance is not directly supported in Java, but it can be simulated using interfaces. In this approach, a class can implement multiple interfaces, which define a set of methods that the class must implement. For example
```
interface Animal {
    void move();
}

interface Pet {
    void play();
}

class Dog implements Animal, Pet {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Dogs can move");
    }

    public void play() {
        System.out.println("Dogs can play");
    }
}
```
In this example, Dog implements both the Animal and Pet interfaces, which define the move() and play() methods, respectively. This allows Dog to have both the behavior of an animal and the behavior of a pet. Note that while this is not true multiple inheritance, it achieves a similar effect.

**What is the super keyword?**
In Java, the super keyword is used to refer to the superclass of a subclass. It can be used in two ways:

1. Call superclass constructor:
When a subclass is instantiated, its constructor automatically calls the constructor of its superclass. If the superclass has a parameterized constructor, the subclass constructor must call it using the super() keyword. For example:
```
class Animal {
    Animal(String name) {
        System.out.println("The animal's name is " + name);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
        System.out.println("The dog's name is " + name);
    }
}
```
In this example, the Animal class has a parameterized constructor that takes a name argument. The Dog class extends Animal, and its constructor calls the Animal constructor using super(name). This ensures that the name parameter is passed to both the Animal and Dog constructors.

2. Call superclass methods:
A subclass can call methods of its superclass using the super keyword. This is useful when the subclass wants to override a method of the superclass but still use some of the superclass's behavior. For example:
```
class Animal {
    void move() {
        System.out.println("Animals can move");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void move() {
        super.move();
        System.out.println("Dogs can run");
    }
}
```
In this example, the Dog class overrides the move() method of Animal, but still calls the move() method of Animal using super.move(). This ensures that the original behavior of move() is preserved, while adding new behavior specific to Dog.

**What is method overriding?**
Method overriding is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass must have the same signature (name, parameters, and return type) as the method in the superclass.

When a method is called on an object of the subclass, the subclass's implementation of the method is executed instead of the superclass's implementation. This allows the subclass to customize the behavior of the inherited method to suit its own specific needs.

Here is an example of method overriding in Java:
```
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}
```
In this example, the Animal class defines a makeSound() method that prints a generic message. The Cat class extends Animal and overrides the makeSound() method with its own implementation that prints "Meow".

When the makeSound() method is called on an instance of Cat, the subclass's implementation is executed instead of the superclass's implementation. For example:
```
Animal animal = new Animal();
animal.makeSound(); // Output: The animal makes a sound

Cat cat = new Cat();
cat.makeSound(); // Output: Meow

Animal catAsAnimal = new Cat();
catAsAnimal.makeSound(); // Output: Meow
```
In the last line, we create an instance of Cat and assign it to a variable of type Animal. Even though the variable is of type Animal, the actual object is still an instance of Cat. When we call makeSound() on the variable, the Cat class's implementation is executed because the object's actual type is used to determine which method to call.

**What is encapsulation?**
Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that refers to the concept of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class. This unit serves as a protective wrapper around the data, preventing it from being accessed or modified by external code without going through the methods provided by the class.

The main goal of encapsulation is to create a well-defined interface between the internal workings of a class and the external code that uses it. This provides a number of benefits, including:

- Improved maintainability: Since the implementation details of a class are hidden from external code, it can be changed without affecting the rest of the program.
- Increased reliability: By controlling access to the data, encapsulation can help prevent bugs and errors caused by external code modifying the data in unexpected ways.
- Improved security: Encapsulation can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by limiting access to only the methods provided by the class.
Here's an example of encapsulation in Java:
```
public class BankAccount {
    private int balance;

    public void deposit(int amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    public void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            balance -= amount;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient funds");
        }
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```
In this example, the BankAccount class encapsulates a private balance field and three public methods for depositing, withdrawing, and retrieving the balance. The balance field is declared as private, meaning that it can only be accessed or modified from within the BankAccount class itself. This ensures that external code cannot modify the balance directly, but must instead use the provided methods to do so. By providing only the methods that are necessary for external code to interact with the BankAccount object, we create a well-defined interface that helps prevent bugs and errors caused by external code modifying the balance in unexpected ways.

**What is abstraction?**
Abstraction is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that refers to the process of focusing on the essential features of an object or system while ignoring the details of its implementation. In other words, abstraction allows us to represent complex systems or concepts in a simplified and abstract way that emphasizes their essential characteristics.

Abstraction can be implemented in object-oriented programming using abstract classes and interfaces. Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated and are meant to be subclassed, while interfaces are collections of abstract methods that define a contract for how a class should behave.

The main benefit of abstraction is that it allows us to create more flexible and modular code that can be easily extended or modified. By focusing on the essential features of an object or system and ignoring the implementation details, we can create code that is more easily adaptable to changing requirements or environments.

```
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract double area();
    public abstract double perimeter();
}

public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }

    public double perimeter() {
        return 2 * (width + height);
    }
}
```
In this example, we define an abstract Shape class that contains two abstract methods for calculating the area and perimeter of a shape. Since Shape is an abstract class, it cannot be instantiated directly, but can be subclassed to create specific shapes.

We then create a Rectangle class that extends Shape and provides its own implementation of the area() and perimeter() methods based on the dimensions of the rectangle. By using abstraction in this way, we create a flexible and modular system that can be easily extended to support new shapes or behaviors without having to modify the Shape or Rectangle classes directly.

Abstraction can also be implemented by using Java interfaces. Abstract classes in java can have non abstract methods, whereas interfaces guarantees that everything in your class is abstract.

```
public interface Shape {
    double getArea();
    double getPerimeter();
}

public class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    public Rectangle(double width, double height) {
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    public double getArea() {
        return width * height;
    }

    public double getPerimeter() {
        return 2 * (width + height);
    }
}
```
In this example, we define a Shape interface that contains two abstract methods for calculating the area and perimeter of a shape. Any class that implements the Shape interface must provide implementations for these methods.

We then create a Rectangle class that implements the Shape interface and provides its own implementation of the getArea() and getPerimeter() methods based on the dimensions of the rectangle. By using an interface in this way, we create a flexible and modular system that can be easily extended to support new shapes or behaviors without having to modify the Shape or Rectangle classes directly.

Note: Any variable in an interface is `public static final`.

**What is polymorphism?**
Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated as if they are objects of the same class. In other words, it allows objects to take on different forms or behave in different ways depending on the context in which they are used.

There are two main types of polymorphism: static (compile-time) polymorphism and dynamic (runtime) polymorphism.

Static polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, which allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters. The correct method to be called is determined at compile-time based on the type and number of arguments passed to the method.

Dynamic polymorphism is achieved through method overriding, which allows a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method defined in its superclass. The correct method to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object being used.

```
public class Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal is making a sound");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog is barking");
    }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cat is meowing");
    }
}

public class PolymorphismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal1 = new Dog();
        Animal animal2 = new Cat();

        animal1.makeSound(); // prints "Dog is barking"
        animal2.makeSound(); // prints "Cat is meowing"
    }
}
```
In this example, we have an Animal class with a makeSound() method that prints a generic message. We then create two subclasses, Dog and Cat, each of which overrides the makeSound() method with its own implementation.

In the main() method, we create two Animal objects, one of type Dog and one of type Cat. When we call the makeSound() method on each of these objects, the correct implementation of the method is determined at runtime based on the actual type of the object, resulting in different messages being printed to the console. This is an example of dynamic polymorphism in action.

Sure! Static polymorphism is achieved through method overloading, which allows multiple methods to have the same name but different parameters. Here's an example in Java:

```
public class MathUtils {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public static int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class StaticPolymorphismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int sum1 = MathUtils.add(1, 2); // calls the int version of the add() method
        double sum2 = MathUtils.add(3.14, 2.71); // calls the double version of the add() method
        int sum3 = MathUtils.add(1, 2, 3); // calls the int version of the add() method
    }
}
```
In this example, we have a MathUtils class with three different versions of an add() method that all have the same name but different parameter types. One version takes two int parameters, one takes two double parameters, and one takes three int parameters.

In the main() method, we call each of these methods with different parameter types. The correct method to be called is determined at compile-time based on the types and number of arguments passed to the method. This is an example of static polymorphism in action.

**What is the static keyword?**
In Java, the static keyword is used to define a class-level variable or method that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. It can be used with variables, methods, and nested classes.

When a variable or method is declared as static, it belongs to the class itself rather than any particular instance of the class. This means that all instances of the class share the same copy of the static variable or method.

Here are some common use cases for the static keyword:

Constants: Constants can be declared as static final variables to ensure that their values cannot be changed and to allow them to be accessed without creating an instance of the class.
Utility methods: Utility methods that perform a general task and don't rely on any instance-specific state can be declared as static methods to allow them to be called without creating an instance of the class.
Counters and trackers: static variables can be used to keep track of the number of instances created or to maintain a global count or state across all instances of the class.
Here's an example of using the static keyword to declare a constant and a utility method:
```
public class MathUtils {
    public static final double PI = 3.14159;

    public static double calculateArea(double radius) {
        return PI * radius * radius;
    }
}

public class StaticExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double area = MathUtils.calculateArea(2.0);
        System.out.println("Area: " + area);
        System.out.println("Pi: " + MathUtils.PI);
    }
}
```
In this example, we have a MathUtils class with a PI constant declared as a static final variable and a calculateArea() method declared as a static method. In the main() method of the StaticExample class, we call the calculateArea() method with a radius of 2.0 and print the result. We also print the value of the PI constant by accessing it using the MathUtils class name and the dot operator. Since both PI and calculateArea() are declared as static, we can access them without creating an instance of the MathUtils class.

**Why multiple inheritence is not good?**
Multiple inheritance is the ability of a programming language to allow a class to inherit properties and behavior from multiple parent classes. While it can be a powerful feature, it also comes with some potential drawbacks that can make it difficult to use effectively.

One of the main issues with multiple inheritance is the "diamond problem", which occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor. In this situation, the subclass ends up with two copies of the properties and behavior of the common ancestor, which can lead to confusion and ambiguity.

Another issue with multiple inheritance is that it can make code more complex and difficult to maintain. When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it can be difficult to understand how all of the inherited properties and behavior work together. Additionally, if one of the parent classes changes, it can have unexpected effects on the subclass.

Finally, multiple inheritance can make it more difficult to ensure code safety and avoid conflicts. For example, if two parent classes define the same method with different implementations, it can be difficult to determine which implementation should be used in the subclass.

**What is coupling and cohesion?**
Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between modules or components in a system. Modules that are highly coupled rely heavily on each other, while modules that are loosely coupled are more independent. High coupling can make a system more difficult to modify or maintain, since changes in one module can have ripple effects throughout the system.

Cohesion refers to the degree to which the elements within a single module or component are related to each other and work together to achieve a single purpose or responsibility. Modules that are highly cohesive are more focused and easier to understand and modify, while modules that are less cohesive may have unrelated or redundant functionality.

**Difference between private, protected, and public modifiers in Java?**
In Java, access modifiers are used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, and nested classes). The three access modifiers available in Java are private, protected, and public. Here are the differences between them:

private: A private member can only be accessed within the same class. It is not visible or accessible outside the class, even to its subclasses. This is the most restrictive access level.

protected: A protected member can be accessed within the same class, subclasses, and classes in the same package. It is not visible or accessible to classes in other packages.

public: A public member can be accessed from anywhere, by any code that has access to the class. It has the least restrictive access level.

Here is a table summarizing the differences:

Access - modifier Visibility
private - Only within the same class
protected - Within the same class, subclasses, and classes in the same package
public - Anywhere, by any code that has access to the class

Here's an example that illustrates the differences between these access modifiers:
```
public class Example {
    private int privateField;
    protected int protectedField;
    public int publicField;
    
    private void privateMethod() {
        // Can only be accessed within the same class
    }
    
    protected void protectedMethod() {
        // Can be accessed within the same class, subclasses, and classes in the same package
    }
    
    public void publicMethod() {
        // Can be accessed from anywhere
    }
}

public class SubExample extends Example {
    public void test() {
        System.out.println(privateField); // Compiler error - privateField is not visible
        System.out.println(protectedField); // Can be accessed since SubExample is a subclass
        System.out.println(publicField); // Can be accessed from anywhere
        
        privateMethod(); // Compiler error - privateMethod is not visible
        protectedMethod(); // Can be accessed since SubExample is a subclass
        publicMethod(); // Can be accessed from anywhere
    }
}

public class OtherExample {
    public void test() {
        Example example = new Example();
        System.out.println(example.privateField); // Compiler error - privateField is not visible
        System.out.println(example.protectedField); // Compiler error - protectedField is not visible
        System.out.println(example.publicField); // Can be accessed from anywhere
        
        example.privateMethod(); // Compiler error - privateMethod is not visible
        example.protectedMethod(); // Compiler error - protectedMethod is not visible
        example.publicMethod(); // Can be accessed from anywhere
    }
}
```
In this example, the Example class has fields and methods with different access modifiers. The SubExample class is a subclass of Example and can access the protected fields and methods. The OtherExample class is not related to Example and can only access the public fields and methods.

**Difference between pass by value and pass by reference?**
In programming, when passing arguments to a function or method, there are two ways that the arguments can be passed: by value and by reference. Here are the differences between the two:

1. Pass by value: When passing arguments by value, a copy of the argument's value is made and passed to the function. This means that any changes made to the argument inside the function are not reflected outside the function. The original value of the argument remains unchanged.

2. Pass by reference: When passing arguments by reference, a reference or pointer to the argument is passed to the function. This means that any changes made to the argument inside the function are reflected outside the function. The original value of the argument can be changed.

Here's an example to illustrate the differences:
```
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
        
        System.out.println("Before: x = " + x);
        changeValue(x);
        System.out.println("After: x = " + x);
        
        System.out.println("Before: arr = " + Arrays.toString(arr));
        changeReference(arr);
        System.out.println("After: arr = " + Arrays.toString(arr));
    }
    
    public static void changeValue(int value) {
        value = 20;
    }
    
    public static void changeReference(int[] reference) {
        reference[0] = 4;
    }
}
```
In this example, the changeValue method takes an int argument and tries to change its value. The changeReference method takes an array argument and changes the value of the first element. When main calls changeValue, a copy of x is passed, so any changes made inside the method do not affect the original x. When main calls changeReference, a reference to arr is passed, so any changes made inside the method are reflected outside the method.

Output when the above program is run:
```
Before: x = 10
After: x = 10
Before: arr = [1, 2, 3]
After: arr = [4, 2, 3]
```
This demonstrates the difference between pass by value and pass by reference. The value of x remains unchanged after calling changeValue, while the value of arr is changed after calling changeReference

Design patterns:

1.  Singleton Pattern: This pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, and provides a global point of access to that instance. For example:
```public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```
You may have a resource, such as a database connection or a file, that you want to share across your application. By using a Singleton, you can ensure that there is only one instance of the object that represents that resource, and all requests for that resource are handled by that single instance. 
- have a private constructor for a singleton -> no one from outside can construct the instance
- have static method to create a singleton

2.  Factory Method Pattern: The Factory Method pattern is used when we want to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. This means that instead of calling the constructor of a class directly, the client calls a factory method that creates an instance of the class for them.
```
public interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

public class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}

public class Cat implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

public class AnimalFactory {
    public Animal createAnimal(String type) {
        if (type.equals("dog")) {
            return new Dog();
        } else if (type.equals("cat")) {
            return new Cat();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid animal type: " + type);
        }
    }
}
```
Here we are creating the dog and cat object for the client based on the input `type` they enter, yet we are not revealing exactly how we are creating the object.

3.  Observer Pattern: This pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. For example:
```
public interface Observer {
    void update(int value);
}

public interface Subject {
    void attach(Observer observer);
    void detach(Observer observer);
    void notifyObservers();
}

public class ConcreteSubject implements Subject {
    private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();
    private int value;

    public void attach(Observer observer) {
        observers.add(observer);
    }

    public void detach(Observer observer) {
        observers.remove(observer);
    }

    public void setValue(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        notifyObservers();
    }

    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer observer : observers) {
            observer.update(value);
        }
    }
}

public class ConcreteObserver implements Observer {
    private int value;

    public void update(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        System.out.println("Value changed to: " + value);
    }
}
```

4. Dependency Injection pattern: Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that facilitates the creation of loosely coupled and highly cohesive code. The idea behind DI is to allow objects to obtain their dependencies from external sources, rather than creating those dependencies themselves. In simple terms, DI is a pattern that allows you to inject an object or a dependency into a class rather than having the class create or retrieve the dependency itself. This allows for greater flexibility and testability in your code.
```
1.  Constructor Injection: This is the most common form of DI, where dependencies are provided as parameters to a class constructor. For example:
public class Car {
   private final Engine engine;
   public Car(Engine engine) {
      this.engine = engine;
   }
}
2.  Setter Injection: This involves setting the dependencies via setter methods. For example:
public class Car {
   private Engine engine;
   public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
      this.engine = engine;
   }
}
```

5. Command pattern: The Command pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing you to parameterize clients. Command pattern is to decouple the requester of an action from the object that actually performs the action.
```
public interface Command {
    void execute();
}

public class LightOnCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;
    
    public LightOnCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }
    
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOn();
    }
}

public class LightOffCommand implements Command {
    private Light light;
    
    public LightOffCommand(Light light) {
        this.light = light;
    }
    
    public void execute() {
        light.turnOff();
    }
}

public class RemoteControl {
    private Command command;
    
    public void setCommand(Command command) {
        this.command = command;
    }
    
    public void pressButton() {
        command.execute();
    }
}

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Light light = new Light();
        Command lightOnCommand = new LightOnCommand(light);
        Command lightOffCommand = new LightOffCommand(light);
        
        RemoteControl remote = new RemoteControl();
        remote.setCommand(lightOnCommand);
        remote.pressButton();
        
        remote.setCommand(lightOffCommand);
        remote.pressButton();
    }
}
```

6. Adapter patter: The Adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It is often used when you need to adapt an existing class to work with a new interface or when you need to use a class that doesn't quite fit with your existing code.
The Adapter pattern involves three main components:
1.  The Client: The client is the code that is using the objects that need to be adapted.
2.  The Target: The target is the interface that the client is expecting to work with.
3.  The Adapter: The adapter is the code that adapts the existing object to work with the target interface.
