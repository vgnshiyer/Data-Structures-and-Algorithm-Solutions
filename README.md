## About

This repository consists of most data structures and algorithms problems along with explanations and pedagogical knowledge to have a great understanding of them and build proper intuition.

Whether you're a seasoned coder or just starting out, this is an incredible opportunity to level up your skills and contribute to a thriving community. By working together, we can tackle a wide range of problems and explore various problem-solving techniques.

## Contributing

Here's how you can get involved:

**Please read the [guidelines below](#contributing-guidelines) before opening a PR**

1️⃣ Fork the GitHub repository https://github.com/vgnshiyer/Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Solutions. \
2️⃣ Explore the collection of problems across popular coding platforms for a particular topic. (Bonus tip: Find commonly asked questions from companies like Google, Amazon, etc.)\
3️⃣ Select a problem that piques your interest or challenges you.\
4️⃣ Develop a solution and submit a pull request with your implementation in a language of your choice. Make sure to include comments explaining the solution.\

## Contributing Guidelines

Solutions from these languages are expected:

* Python
* C++
